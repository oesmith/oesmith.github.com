title: Install Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7 in OS X Mountain Lion
---

<p>Upgrading to Mountain Lion will wipe your old dev environment, so this is what you&#8217;ll need to get back to work on ree-1.8.7:</p>



<p><strong>1. Install XCode command-line tools.</strong>  Available from the <em>Preferences &gt; Download</em> panel in XCode, or as a separate download from the Apple Developer site.</p>



<p><strong>2. Install gcc-4.2.</strong>  REE doesn&#8217;t play well with Apple&#8217;s LLVM compiler, so you&#8217;ll need to install the old gcc-4.2 compiler.  It&#8217;s available in the homebrew <em>homebrew/dupes</em> repository.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/dupes

brew install apple-gcc42

</code></pre>



<p><strong>3. Install xquartz.</strong>  The OS X upgrade will also remove your old X11.app installation, so go grab xquartz from <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a> and install it (you&#8217;ll need v2.7.2 or later for Mountain Lion).</p>



<p><strong>4. Install ree.</strong>  Remember to add the path to the xquartz X11 includes in CPPFLAGS and the path to gcc-42 in CC.  Here I&#8217;m using rbenv, but the same environment variables should work for rvm.</p>



<pre><code>CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/X11/include \

CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.2 \

rbenv install ree-1.8.7-2012.02

</code></pre>
