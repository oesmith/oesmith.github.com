<p>I’ve been fiddling with OpenCV on-and-off in my spare time for a few weeks now, and I’m starting to get a feel for the challenges involve in number plate recognition. There’s plenty of papers and background material out there to keep me reading for months <a href="http://delicious.com/olly.smith/ANPR">clicky</a>.</p>



<p>The simple approach as used by a number of researchers is to concentrate on thresholding the image (sometimes many levels of thresholding), and then doing a bit of connected component labelling to find candidate regions of the image to extract and pass to a second-stage character recognition algorithm.</p>



<p>Here’s my first attempt. Source image, then thresholded and labelled image.</p>
