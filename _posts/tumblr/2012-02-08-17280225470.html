title: OBDII Wi-Fi Hacking
---

<p>There are plenty of these OBDII WiFi modules advertised for sale on eBay.  I&#8217;ve recently bought a RenaultSport Clio which has an OBDII port, so I picked up one to experiment with.</p>

<p>This little gadget plugs into the OBDII port in the Clio (which is hidden behind a removable panel just below the ignition card key slot).  It creates an ad-hoc WiFi network and listens on a TCP port for client connections.</p>



<p>The chip that does all the hard work of connecting to the car&#8217;s onboard computer(s) is an ELM327-compatible, which means it speaks a simple ASCII protocol.  Control messages are sent to the chip using old-school AT commands (like old-school modems), and OBD comms use simple hex strings.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick example:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;ATZ

ELM327 v1.4

&gt;0100

41 00 9E 3E B8 11

&gt;0120

41 20 80 00 00 00

&gt; 0105

41 05 48

</code></pre>



<p>The <code>ATZ</code> command resets the interface chip (and displays its ID).  The rest of the commands all request data from the ECU using OBD mode 1.</p>



<p><code>0100</code> and <code>0120</code> enumerate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs#Standard_PIDs">OBD PIDs</a> supported by my car.  The data returned is a header (<code>41 00</code> / <code>41 20</code>) followed by the actual data as a bit-encoded set of flags.</p>



<p><code>0105</code> queries the ECU for the current engine temperature (which, in this case, returns a temperature of 32Â°C).</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to carry on hacking with this module, and I&#8217;m hoping to build a natty little iOS telemetry app to use with it.  Stay tuned for further blog posts as I learn more!</p>
