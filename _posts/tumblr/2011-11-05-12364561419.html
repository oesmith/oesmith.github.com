title: Debian Wheezy Killed My Pogoplug
---

<p>After months of running a hybrid sarge/wheezy installation on my Pogoplug (the wheezy bits needed for <a href="http://www.oesmith.co.uk/post/7897354360/make-timemachine-in-os-x-lion-work-with-debian-squeeze">OS X Lion Time Machine support in netatalk</a>), a power cut forced a reboot.  Unfortunately the poor thing never came back to life.</p>



<p>A prod with an FTDI cable on the <a href="http://www.hack247.co.uk/pogo-plug-pink-serial-connection/">Pogoplug&#8217;s serial headers</a> retrieved the following console grumbles:</p>



<pre><code>udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

udevd[45]: unable to receive ctrl connection: Function not implemented

</code></pre>



<p>It seems a package update had introduced a version of udevd that the poor Pogoplug&#8217;s kernel isn&#8217;t able to support.  The good news is that you don&#8217;t really need the debian-installed udevd daemon.  The initrd image that the Pogoplug boots from has its own, older udevd which is capable enough.</p>



<p>Plugging the pogoplug&#8217;s root disk into a Linux laptop and disabling the udevd daemon (insert <code>exit 0</code> somewhere near the top of <code>/etc/init.d/udev</code>) brought my Pogoplug&#8217;s back to life, and it&#8217;ll hopefully mean I don&#8217;t have to consider a more expensive NAS for a long time yet.  Yay!</p>
