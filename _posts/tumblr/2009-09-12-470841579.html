<p>Since the last update, I’ve been concentrating on stopping character shapes from bleeding into other elements of the image – mostly it’s been the edges of number plates that have been getting in the way. I’ve used a hough transform to find the number plate edges and eliminate them from the thresholded image before component labeling. I’ve also discarded some of the components based on a bit of filtering after labeling.</p>
