title: Time for a project...

<p>Something to distract me from the television: an open-source project!</p>



<p>I know nothing about the field of computer vision, so this was obviously the most suitable area to base my project in. I’m going to attempt to write an open-source automatic vehicle registration number recognition library.</p>



<p>I’m going to be coding in Python (because I need its wicked rad awesomeness in my life), and relying a heck of a lot on <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a> for the underlying hardcore bit-pushing shit.</p>



<p>The project is on <a href="http://github.com/oesmith/OpenANPR">github</a> <em>now</em>. There’s nothing there to see yet, but a few watchers would be very encouraging.</p>
