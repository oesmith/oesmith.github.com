title: Time for a project...

Something to distract me from the television: an open-source project!

I know nothing about the field of computer vision, so this was obviously the
most suitable area to base my project in. I’m going to attempt to write an
open-source automatic vehicle registration number recognition library.

I’m going to be coding in Python (because I need its wicked rad awesomeness in
my life), and relying a heck of a lot on [OpenCV][1] for the underlying
hardcore bit-pushing shit.

The project is on [github][2] *now*. There’s nothing there to see yet, but a
few watchers would be very encouraging.
