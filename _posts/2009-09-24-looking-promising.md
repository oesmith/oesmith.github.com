title: Looking promising...

Had a bit of a brainwave the other night — clustering connected components
using size similarity, locality and fit to a line as criteria. The image shows
the kind of results I’m getting with a really quick script thrown together late
last night.

![Plates outlined](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2656/3949212304_937b7dd91f.jpg)

Blue boxes outline the individual characters that have been recognised, red
boxes outline clusters.

It’s sometimes missing some of the characters at the ends of the plates, and
there are still some false positives showing up in some images, but I’m fairly
confident that a bit of tuning could fix all that.

Yay!
