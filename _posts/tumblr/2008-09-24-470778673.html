title: Netatalk on an Ubuntu virtual machine
---

<p>I tend to develop on a MacBook running OS X Leopard. In order to keep my main Leopard system clean and tidy, I use Parallels desktop to run my development environments in virtual machines. Parallels is jolly good at sharing data with Windows virtual machines, but a bit lacking when it comes to Linux. Hence I’ve started using netatalk on all my Linux virtual machines to access their disk drives from OS X.</p>



<p>Lots has been written about what it takes to install and tweak netatalk to get it to talk happily with Leopard, so I won’t go into the problems here. All you need to know should be found at the following links.</p>

</ul><p>The process below is an amalgamation of all the instructions from those pages, put together to form the process I go through to set up netatalk on my virtual machines.</p>



<p>Firstly, one needs to download the netatalk source, install all of its dependencies and build it with ssl enabled.</p>



<pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/src/netatalk

$ cd ~/src/netatalk

$ sudo aptitude install devscripts cracklib2-dev dpkg-dev libssl-dev

$ apt-get source netatalk

$ sudo apt-get build-dep netatalk

$ cd netatalk-2.0.3

$ sudo su

# DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=ssl dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

# debi

# echo "netatalk hold" | dpkg --set-selections

# exit

</code></pre>



<p>That should have build and installed the netatalk package, and told the debian packaging system to not replace it if a new version appears in the online repositories.</p>



<p>The only netatalk service I’m interested is the file sharing one, so the rest can be turned off in /etc/default/netatalk:</p>



<pre><code># Set which daemons to run (papd is dependent upon atalkd):

ATALKD_RUN=no

PAPD_RUN=no

CNID_METAD_RUN=no

AFPD_RUN=yes

TIMELORD_RUN=no

A2BOOT_RUN=no

</code></pre>



<p>Finally, to enable zeroconf/bonjour discovery of the shares on the system, install avahi-daemon and add a service definition to /etc/avahi/services/afpd.service to advertise the afp service.</p>



<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone=‘no’?&gt;&lt;!–*-nxml-*–&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd"&gt;

&lt;service-group&gt;

  &lt;name&gt;%u&lt;/name&gt;

  &lt;service&gt;

    &lt;type&gt;_afpovertcp._tcp&lt;/type&gt;

    &lt;port&gt;548&lt;/port&gt;

  &lt;/service&gt;

&lt;/service-group&gt;

</code></pre>



<p>And that’s it! You should now be able to reliably mount your home directory on the Linux virtual machine from OS X.</p>
