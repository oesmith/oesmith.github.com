title: Looking promising...

<p>Had a bit of a brainwave the other night—clustering connected components using size similarity, locality and fit to a line as criteria. The image shows the kind of results I’m getting with a really quick script thrown together late last night.</p>



<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2656/3949212304_937b7dd91f.jpg" alt="Plates outlined"/></p>



<p>Blue boxes outline the individual characters that have been recognised, red boxes outline clusters.</p>



<p>It’s sometimes missing some of the characters at the ends of the plates, and there are still some false positives showing up in some images, but I’m fairly confident that a bit of tuning could fix all that.</p>



<p>Yay!</p>
