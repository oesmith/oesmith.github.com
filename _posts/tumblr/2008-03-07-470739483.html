title: Subversion and Visual C++
---

<p>Despite mostly using Java for the work I’m doing at the moment, there’s still some call for a bit of C++. Visual Studio 2005<sup>1</sup> is still the daddy of all IDEs for developing in C++ as far as I’m concerned, but all the intermediate cruft that it generates doesn’t really need checking in to my Subversion repository.</p>

<p>You can cut down the extraneous crap by excluding all <code>debug</code> and <code>release</code> directories, and all <code>.ncb</code>, <code>.suo</code>, <code>.vcproj.USERNAME.user</code> and <code>.aps</code> files.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Yes, I know 2008 is available, and I’ve even got it downloaded from MSDN, but I’ve not got around to installing it yet…</p>
